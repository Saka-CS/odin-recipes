        </li>
        <li>
            Cook Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until crumbly, browned, and no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes.

        <li>
            Drain, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings with the bacon in the bottom of the Dutch oven. Stir in onions and garlic; cook until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat.
        </li>
