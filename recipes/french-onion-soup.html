                2 tablespoons olive oil

                4 cups sliced onions
            </li>

                5 cups beef broth

                2 tablespoons dry sherry

            <li>
                1 teaspoon dried thyme
            </li>
            <li>
                1 pinch salt and pepper to taste
            </li>
            <li>
                3 quarts water
            </li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Gather all ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt butter with olive oil in an 8-quart stock pot over medium heat. Add onions to butter and continually stir until tender and translucent. Do not brown the onions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add beef broth, sherry, and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Let simmer for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven's broiler.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ladle soup into oven-safe serving bowls and place one slice of bread on top of each (bread may be broken into pieces if you prefer). Layer each slice of bread with a slice of provolone, 1/2 slice diced Swiss and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place bowls on a cookie sheet and broil in the preheated oven until cheese bubbles and browns slightly, 2 to 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve hot and enjoy!
